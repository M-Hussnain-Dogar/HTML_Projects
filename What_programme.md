# 🧠 Information about Programming

**Programming** is the process of writing instructions (called **code**) that a computer can understand and execute to perform specific tasks.

It’s like giving **step-by-step directions** to a computer to solve a problem, automate a task, or create something — such as a game, app, or website.

## 🤖 Example in Real Life

Imagine telling a robot:

➡️ Go to the kitchen  
➡️ Pick up a cup  
➡️ Pour water  
➡️ Bring it back  

That’s essentially what programming is — telling machines exactly **what to do** and **how to do it**.

## 💻 Programming Languages

Programs are written in various languages. Each has its own syntax, structure, and purpose:

1. **Python** – Great for beginners, AI, automation  
2. **C** – Low-level, fast, used in system programming  
3. **C++** – Builds on C with object-oriented features  
4. **Java** – Widely used in Android apps and backend systems  
5. **C#** – Developed by Microsoft, used in Windows and game development (Unity)  
6. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Core trio for building modern websites  

> 🧩 HTML is for structure, CSS is for style, and JS is for interactivity
