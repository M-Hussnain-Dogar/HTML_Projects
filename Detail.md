# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Overview

## ðŸ”¹ HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the **foundation of every webpage**. It defines the structure and content using tags like:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings  
- `<p>` for paragraphs  
- `<a>` for links  
- `<img>` for images  
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for lists  
- `<div>` and `<span>` for layout and styling  
- Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`

HTML tells the browser **what to show**, not how it should look or behave.

## ðŸ”¹ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to **style the HTML content**. It controls layout, colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and responsiveness. CSS can be written in three ways:

- **Inline**: inside the HTML element  
- **Internal**: in a `<style>` tag  
- **External**: in a separate `.css` file

**Key concepts:**

- **Selectors**: target HTML elements (`h1`, `.class`, `#id`)
- **Box model**: `margin`, `border`, `padding`, `content`
- **Flexbox & Grid**: modern layout tools
- **Media queries**: for responsive design
- **Animations & transitions**: for effects and interactivity

## ðŸ”¹ JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript is a **scripting language** that makes webpages interactive. It runs in the browser and lets you:

- Dynamically update HTML and CSS (DOM manipulation)
- Respond to user actions (clicks, input)
- Validate forms
- Make API requests (`AJAX`, `Fetch`)
- Handle animations
- Store data locally (`localStorage`, cookies)

You can include JavaScript in:

- `<script>` tags in HTML  
- External `.js` files

JavaScript frameworks and libraries like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular** are built on top of it.

## ðŸ”„ How They Work Together

These three layers form the core of web development:

- **HTML** â€“ Structure/content (skeleton)
- **CSS** â€“ Style/layout (skin)
- **JS** â€“ Behavior/interactivity (muscle/nervous system)

A modern, interactive site needs all three.  
**Example**: A login form (**HTML**) that looks nice (**CSS**) and checks your password live (**JS**).
